# Customer Churn Analysis Project using Power BI
Welcome to the Customer Churn Analysis project repository!

## Project Overview

This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive Customer Churn Analysis using Microsoft Power BI. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is a critical business metric that measures the rate at which customers stop using a company's product or service. By understanding churn patterns, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## Dataset

For this analysis, we utilized a fictitious dataset from company Databel. The dataset contains various customer attributes, such as demographic information, contract type, contract duration, region etc.

The first phase of the project involved performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset. During EDA, data was examined, checked for missing values, and gained initial insights into the data distribution. EDA provided crucial insights that laid the foundation for further analysis.
In the second phase of the project, we focused on analyzing churn patterns within the dataset.
The final phase of the project involved leveraging the power of Microsoft Power BI to create interactive data visualizations and a comprehensive report.

## How to Use the Power BI Report

Download the Power BI report file Churn Case Study.pbix.
Install Power BI Desktop, if you don't have it installed already.
Open Power BI Desktop and open the downloaded file.
Once the report is loaded, you can interact with the visuals, apply filters, and explore the customer churn analysis.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to DataCamp for providing the case study and dataset for this project. Their contribution made this analysis possible and helped me gain valuable insights into customer churn.

I hope you find the insights valuable and applicable to your business scenarios. Happy analyzing!
